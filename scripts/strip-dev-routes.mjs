/**
 * Strip dev-only routes from the source tree before `next build` runs in a
 * production build. This makes them physically absent from the .next/
 * output, not merely runtime-disabled.
 *
 * Closes finding W1.6 from docs/security/ClubIt-Security-Assessment.md.
 *
 * Why: the previous defense was `if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'development')`
 * checks at the top of each handler. Three failure modes:
 *   1. Vercel preview deployments default to NODE_ENV=production but a
 *      misconfigured project could leak through.
 *   2. Anyone who wires up a custom build pipeline could accidentally
 *      ship the dev tree.
 *   3. The compiled handlers still exist in .next/ and could be reached
 *      via a Next.js routing bug.
 *
 * This script removes the directories outright. For local dev, run plain
 * `npm run build` (no strip); for production, run `npm run build:prod`
 * which composes strip -> next build -> verify.
